####  Project Title: Kalakar

## The Local Artist Connect System is a Full Stack Java-based platform designed to bridge the gap between local artists and individuals or organizations looking for artistic talent. The system allows artists to register and showcase their expertise, making it easier for event organizers, businesses, and art enthusiasts to find and connect with them based on specific fields of interest.
